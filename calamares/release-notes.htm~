    <h3>Release Notes for siduction 2017.01</h3>
    <p>Today we are proud to release siduction 2017.1 with the flavours KDE, LXQt,
       GNOME, Cinnamon, MATE, XFCE, LXDE, Xorg and noX. The fact that Debian is in
       deep freeze for Debian 9 »Stretch« allows us to release the whole stack. As
       I <a href="https://news.siduction.org/2017/02/next-release-plans/" target="_blank">posted before</a>
       not too long ago, we planned the release before going to CLT-Conference on
       11./12. of March, and voila - here it is.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The released images are a snapshot of Debian unstable, that also goes by the
       name of Sid, from 2017-XX-XX. They are enhanced with some useful packages and
       scripts, a brand new installer and a custom patched version of the linux-kernel
       4.10, accompanied by X-Server 1.19.0-4 and systemd 232-18.
    </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Desktop Environments</strong>
<p> Debians freeze enables us to release all our flavours at once, but it also means that there were hardly any changes to the flavours  noX, Xorg, LXDE, Xfce and Plasma 5, that we released in December 2016. So Plasma 5 did not yet move to 5.9, which is an update many users wait for. Some of the other desktops Gnome, Cinnamon, Mate and LXQt have seen updates since the last release. Specialy LXQt made quiet some advance and is also available in Debian now.</p><br>
    <strong>New Installer</strong>
    <p>Work on the new installer built from the <a href="https://calamares.io/about/" target="_blank">Calamares Installer Framework</a>,
       which we are very happy about was pretty much straight forward. So, with this
       new release, our old installer, that was often critisized as not being very
       clear in its graphical appearance, is being retired and Calamares takes its
       place.
    </p>
    <br>
    <strong>UEFI installs made easy</strong>
    <p>With Calamares we can offer full implementation of UEFI-Installs, which were
       still a bit cumbersome with the old installer. Besides that it offers almost
       everything, the old installer did. For now we have turned off encryption with
       LUKS, which Calamares offers as an option. We want to be on top of that feature
       before we offer it to you. Offering it means we need to be able to support this
       critical functionality. We do not feel we can do this adequatly at the moment,
       but we will further look into it for our next release.
    </p>
    <br>

    <strong>Shortcomings</strong>
    <p>What Calamares cannot do at this point of its developement is LVM, but that is
       being worked on. so hopefully when we feel comfortable with encryption in the
       installer, LVM will be ready and they can go hand in hand. That leaves two things
       that will not be included in the new installer. One is the option to turn on SSH
       before installing the system. Calamares does not offer that and before writing a
       calamares module for this, we decided to just build 2 small scripts to turn SSH on
       and off. They are aptly named <em>SSH Activate</em> and <em>SSH Deactivate</em>
       and you can find them in your menu.
    </p>
    <br>

    <strong>Non-free software</strong>
    <p>The other option that the installer does not offer anymore is the decision to
       opt-out to allow software to be installed that does not comply with DFSG, the
       Debian Free Software Guidelines. If you did not use the opt-out, non-free packages
       firmware enabling your wifi or graphics drivers as well as the CPU were installed on the system. As there
       is no option to do that in Calamares, for now we have added a script called
       <em>remove-nonfree</em> to siduction-scripts, that will remove any non-free
       packages from the package list. A list of the packages involved can be seen below.
       The command <code>vrms</code> will also list these packages, should you want to
       remove them manualy after install. Besides running the script, this can be achieved
       by issuing <code>apt purge $(vrms -s -q)</code>.

    <strong>Disclaimer</strong>
    <p>You need to be aware that this behaviour is not in accordance with the Debian
       Free Software Guide (DFSG). We offer an opt-out by script from this to go back
       to a DFSG-compliant installation.
    </p>
    <br>

    <strong>Changes to our release model</strong>
    <p>Besides that, we will slightly alter our release model. During the past release
       cycles we learned that with as many flavours as we have and with the ressources
       we can muster, we find it very hard to release all flavours together in one release.
       This made it hard to release in the past, which leaves new users with growing first
       upgrades as time moves on. To prevent that from happening again, in the future we
       will release flavours as soon as they are ready and benefit the user. We will still
       try to release more than one at a time, but not neccesarily wait for a chance to
       release all of them together.

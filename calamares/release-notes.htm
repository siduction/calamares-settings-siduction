    <h2>Release Notes for siduction 2018.3.0</h2>
    <p>In the attempt to release more often, today we give you siduction 2018.3.0 with the flavours
    KDE, LXQt, GNOME, Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce, Lxde, Xorg and noX. The released images are a snapshot
    of Debian unstable, that also goes by the name of Sid, from 2018-05-12. They are enhanced with
    some useful packages and scripts, an installer based on Calamares and a custom patched version
    of the linux-kernel 4.16.8, accompanied by X-Server 1.19.6-1 and systemd 238.4.</p>

    <p>KDE Plasma stands at version 5.12.5, while GNOME comes in at 3.28.1, with 3.28.2 waiting in
    the wings. LXQt ships at 0.12.0 and Xfce at 4.12.4, while Cinnamon comes in at 3.6.7-8 and MATE
    at 1.20.0.</p>

    <p>This release comes with the name “patience 2018.3.0”. How we deal with release names in the
    future is unclear. The next release will ship whatever we come up with. Maybe it’ll be just
    numbers… But patience for a distribution based on sid is not such a bad moniker after all :)</p>

    <h2>Release Highlights</h2>
    <h3>Plasma 5.12-5, KF 5.45</h3>
    <p>We are happy to say, KDE moved up a notch in Debian and Plasma 5.12.5 is well into its LTS
    cycle, accompanied by KDE Frameworks 5.45.0-1. Plasma 5.12 is a LTS release and has some nice
    improvements. The dash now has an extra tab which integrates plasmoids in the menu.
    Plasma 5.12-5 feels more snappy, needs less CPU and memory resources. Flatpak is fully
    integrated in Discover.</p>

    <h3>Ncurses </h3>
    With the new version of <em>ncurses 6.1-1</em>, that we cherry-picked, users of Htop will be
    happy to find out, that this magnificent tool gained the ability to let you wheel through the
    processes with the mouse.</p>
	
	<h3>Connman 1.36</p>
	Our LXQt flavour will contain connman 1.36 which was released yesterday - one might don't see
	differences in behaviour since we follow connman upstream very close - but it is nice to have
	a released version in. 

    <h2>New features from this years releases</h2>
    <h3>Meltdown &amp; Spectre</h3>
    <p>Shortly after our release 2018.1.0 the world made acquaintance with two vulnerabilities that
    will stay with us for a long time. In mitigating Meltdown &amp; Spectre, siduction was as close
    to the kernel as possible to be able to get fixes in as soon as they roll out. Kernel 4.15 had
    most of the bases covered and now there is far more mitigation with 4.16.8.</p>
	
    <p>We expect this to be going on for a while, specialy since 8 new vulnerabilities have just been
    discovered. For users to be able to easily check the status of their systems regarding Meltdown &amp;
    Spectre, we added the package <em>spectre-meltdown-checker</em> to the image. Just call it as
    root and you will see at a glance where you are in that regard.</p>

    <h3>Ceni removed</h3>
    <p>We have removed Ceni (for setting up /etc/network/interfaces/) from all flavours but noX and
    Xorg. It interfers with Network-Manager and speaks only IPv4. Besides that it is easy enough to
    get a dhcp lease with `dhclient`, if you have a network cable at hand. You can still find Ceni in
    the archive, should you want to install it.</p>

    <h3>Recommends enabled</h3>
    <p>Years ago we decided to not install recommends anymore for our releases or when the user
    installs a package. The handling of that feature in Debian was not as we thought it should be.
    A lot of cruft was installed to the system and we wanted to prevent that. Times have changed
    and so has the handling of recommends. So now the recommends that the maintainer sets for a
    package are installed in siduction. If you would like recommends not installed, you can override
    our decision in `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/80-siduction` in the line `APT::Install-Recommends "1";`.</p>

    <h3>Rotation for Journald</h3>
    <p>To prevent the journal from growing too large we have implemented a journal-rotation and a
    maximum size to the journal. You can overrule this setting by editing the files in
    `/etc/journal.conf.d/`. There will be a blog post on this topic within the next days.</p>

    <h3>SSH Handling</h3>
    <p>We built two small scripts to turn SSH on and off in the live and in the installed system.
    They are aptly named <em>SSH Activate</em> and <em>SSH Deactivate</em> and you can find them in
    your menu.</p>

    <h3>Calamares – our not all that new installer</h3>
    <p>This is the 4th release with the new installer built from the Calamares Installer Framework
    and we are quite happy with it. It is under steady developement and will in the near future
    improve quite a bit on LVM and LUKS2. The partitioning is done by the brand new kpmcore 3.3.1
    (git), which is also at the heart of the KDE Partition Manager (KPM). The corresponding package
    for that is called <em>partitionmanager</em>.</p>

    <h4>UEFI installs made easy</h4>
    <p>With Calamares we can proclaim full implementation of UEFI-Installs since 2017.1.0. For now
    we still have encryption with LUKS and LVM turned off, which Calamares offers as an option. We
    want to be on top of that feature before we offer it to you. Offering it means we need to be
    able to support this critical functionality. We do not feel we can do this adequatly at the
    moment, as it is an ongoing developement, that should be more mature with kpmcore 3.4.</p>

    <h4>Non-free software</h4>
    <p>Right now the installer does not offer the option to opt-out software that does not comply
    with DFSG, the Debian Free Software Guidelines. That means that non-free packages would be
    installed by default on the system. The command vrms will list these packages. One can remove
    not wanted packages manually or remove them all by issuing `apt purge $(vrms -s)` before or
    after installation.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>New paste script</h2>
    <p>We have retired the old paste-script, that ran under the name
    <code>siduction-paste</code>. It's place was taken by what is now called
    <code>simple-paste</code>. Simple-paste is a cli swiss army-knife for pasting,
    written in bash, powered by pb. It supports command output, different kinds
    of screenshots, (auto-)deletable pastes and much more.</p>

    <h2>32-bit architecture was retired recently</h2>
    <p>As already mentioned in the news section, with the 2017.1.0 release we retired
    the 32-bit architecture. The work that it took to build and maintain that
    architecture is in our humble opinion better invested in other places. Users
    that still need 32-bit can come talk to us on IRC or send a PM and we will
    try to find a solution for these particular cases.</p>

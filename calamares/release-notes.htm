    <h2>Release Notes for siduction 2018.1.0</h2>
    <p>Today we are proud to release siduction 2018.1.0 with the flavours KDE,
    LXQt, GNOME, Cinnamon, MATE, XFCE, LXDE, Xorg and noX. The released images
    are a snapshot of Debian unstable, that also goes by the name of Sid,
    from 2017-29-12. They are enhanced with some useful packages and scripts,
    a brand new installer and a custom patched version of the linux-kernel 4.14.9,
    accompanied by X-Server 1.19.5 and systemd 236.</p>

    <p>KDE Plasma stands at version 5.10.5, while GNOME comes in at 3.26 with
    some packages still at 3.24. LXQt ships at 0.12.0 and Xfce at 4.12.4, while
    Cinnamon comes in at 3.4.6 and MATE at 1.18.3. Sadly, right now, GNOME,
    MATE and LXDE are largely unmaintained. If noone steps up to keep them in a
    releaseable state, we might have to drop these flavours with our next release.
    The corresponding packages will stay in the archives.</p>

    <p>This release comes with the name "patience 2018.1.0". How we deal with
    this in the future is unclear. The next release, which might be there in March,
    in advance of <a href="https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2018/en/">CLT 2018</a>,
    will ship whatever we come up with. Maybe it'll be just numbersâ€¦ </p>

    <h2>Release Highlights</h2>
    <h3>Recommends enabled</h3>
    <p>Years ago we decided to not install recommends anymore for our releases or when the user
    installs a package. The handling of that feature in Debian was not as we thought it should be.
    A lot of cruft was installed to the system and we wanted to prevent that. Times have changed
    and so has the handling of recommends. So now the recommends that the maintainer
    sets for a package are installed in siduction. If you would like recommends
    not installed, you can override our decision in
    <em>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/80-siduction</em> in the line <em>APT::Install-Recommends "1";</em>.</p>

    <h3>Rotation for Journald</h3>
    <p>To prevent the journal from growing too large we have implemented a journal-rotation
    and a maximum size to the journal. You can overrule this setting by editing the
    files in <em>/etc/journal.conf.d/</em>. There will be a blog post on this topic
    within the next days.</p>

    <h3>New paste script</h3>
    We have retired our old paste-script, siduction-paste. Its place is taken by simple-paste,
    which is a cli swiss army-knife for pasting, written in bash, powered by pb. It supports
    command output, different kinds of screenshots, (auto-)deletable pastes and much more.

    <h3>SSH Handling</h3>
    <p>We built two small scripts to turn SSH on and off in the live and in the
    installed system. They are aptly named <em>SSH Activate</em> and <em>SSH Deactivate</em>
    and you can find them in your menu.

    <h3>Calamares - our new installer</h3>
    <p>This is the 2nd release with the new installer built from the
    <a href="https://calamares.io/about/" target="_blank">Calamares Installer Framework</a>
    and we are quite happy with it. It is under steady developement and will in
    the near future improve quite a bit on LVM and LUKS2.</p>

    <p>The partitioning is done by the brand new <code>kpmcore 3.3.0</code>, which
    is also at the heart of the KDE Partition Manager (KPM). The corresponding package
    for that is called <code>partitionmanager</code>.</p>

    <h4>UEFI installs made easy</h4>
    <p>With Calamares we can proclaim full implementation of UEFI-Installs since 2017.1.0.
    For now we still have encryption with LUKS and LVM turned off, which Calamares offers
    as an option. We want to be on top of that feature before we offer it to you. Offering
    it means we need to be able to support this critical functionality. We do not feel we
    can do this adequatly at the moment, as it is an ongoing developement, that should be
    more mature with <code>kpmcore 3.4</code>.</p>

    <h4>Non-free software</h4>
    <p>The installer does not offer the option to opt-out software that does not
    comply with DFSG, the Debian Free Software Guidelines. That means that non-free
    packages would be installed by default on the system. The command
    <code>vrms</code> will list these packages. One can
    remove not wanted packages manually or remove them all by issuing
    <code>apt purge $(vrms -s)</code> before or after installation</p>

    The very same topic has ruffled feathers on the debian deverloper mailing list
    last month with two extensive threads and a
    <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/12/msg00161.html">
    possible future solution layed out by Russ Allbery</a>.

    <h2>32-bit architecture was retired with last release</h2>
    <p>As already mentioned in the <a href="https://news.siduction.org/2017/02/">news section</a>,
    with the 2017.1.0 release we retired the 32-bit architecture. The work that it
    took to build and maintain that architecture is in our humble opinion better
    invested in other places. Users that still need 32-bit can come talk to us on
    IRC or send a PM and we will try to find a solution for these particular cases.</p>

    <h1>Next release plans</h1>
    <p>We are planning to release a full set of siduction images with all flavours
    before going to CLT (Chemnitzer Linux-Tage) next month. There are at least three
    reasons for that:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>We can boast about it at the conference</li>
       <li>We will have a new installer for you to try</li>
       <li>We promised to do so</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And here are the gory details: Six years ago we thought it would be a cool
    idea to have our installer running in a browser with the help of a tiny http
    server. Today for some reasons we do not think it is quite that cool. One of
    the reasons for that being the fact, that the guy who initialy wrote the
    installer is not available anymore. </p>

    <p>Then, about three years ago someone by the name of Teo Mrnjavac had a
    marvelous idea, that will, similar to systemd, unify linux in a in my
    humble opinion positive way. I am talking about the Calamares Installer
    Framework. As you can see at the bottom of
    <a href="https://calamares.io/about/" target="_blank">their webpage</a>,
    your favorite distro is listed there already. It is used more and more by
    distributions and every one of them makes the code better. Sharing one
    installer eases a lot of problems for smaller distributions. The partitioning
    is done by KDE's partition manager. What it does not do yet is LVM and RAID,
    but those are in the pipeline. Also, Calamares will make it's way into Debian
    soon.</p>

    <p>So for the past weeks that is what we have been working on. Calamares is C++,
    Qt 5 for the user interface and python modules to pick what you need and
    configure to your liking. Then apply a branding and you are done. Of course
    this was the fast-forward-mode, but we managed to get it up and running in less
    than two weeks. We are doing more testing to make sure it lives up to it's
    reputation with siduction as well. </p>

    <p>It also works fine with BIOS and UEFI, which kills another problem for us:
    The integration of UEFI in the old installer was far from perfect and included
    manual setup work before starting the installer. Given that we do not run into
    any blockers with the installer, we are confident that the freeze for Debian
    GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" will allow us a release of all flavours without too many
    problems.</p>

    <p>We also plan to make this next release our first release with 64-bit only.
    Yep, we think the time is right to drop the 32-bit plattform without making too
    many users unhappy. Should you be one of those not happy with our plan, please
    let us know your reasons on our forum. If you have a good reason to still
    run 32-bit, you might even be able to talk us into a custom build. But overall,
    dropping this architecture saves us a lot of time that can be better spent
    elsewhere.</p>

        <h3>In memoriam Axel Beu</h3>
        
        <p>For our good friend and sponsor, who left us much too young!</p>
        
        <p>This is still beta, a new release is coming soon!</p>
        
        <!--<h3>Release Notes for C-Blues 2021.1.1 (Point Release)</h3>-->

<!--        <p>To circumvent a bug that made the Calamares installer fail to create GPT partitions      in EFI mode, we have released a siduction 2021.1.1 point release. For the technically inclined users among you let me dive into what happened behind the scenes of <a href="https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/1637">this bug</a>. A new version 4.2 of <a href="https://github.com/dosfstools/dosfstools">dosfstools</a> prevents <a href="https://github.com/KDE/kpmcore">kpmcore</a>, which sits at the heart of KDE Partition Manager and gets utilized in Calamares, to create GPT partitions. </p>

        <h3>Dosfstools is to blame</h3>

        <p>Dosfstools no longer allows empty labels, but it also changed the way labels are reset. In the specific use case of creating a fat32 partition for the ESP, there is no label to reset as the partition does not exist yet. And so the installation fails, whereas if partitions are created before the installation and then pointed to in Calamares, things worked as expected.</p>

        <h3>Downgrade to the rescue</h3>

        <p>A fixed official version of dosfstools in the repositories will take a while, so we decided to downgrade dosfstools to 4.1.2, which resulted in the package <em>dosfstools 4.2-1.1~really4.1-2</em>. This point release is only important for fresh installs with Calamares. That is why noX did not get updated, it only has the cli-installer, no Calamares. Users, who have installed siduction already, don’t need to do anything.</p>

        <p>The siduction team is proud to present to you siduction 2021.1.0 After a long hiatus of almost 3 years we are happy to be back with an official release. This one is dubbed »C-Blues«, and it should be easy to guess what the »C« stands for in these troubled times. </p>

        <hr />
        
        <h3>Release Notes for C-Blues 2021.1.0</h3>

        <h3>What have we got here?</h3>

        <p>The flavors we offer for siduction 2021.1.0 are KDE Plasma 5.20.5, LXQt 0.16.0-1, Cinnamon 4.8.6, Xfce 4.16, Lxde 10, Xorg and noX. GNOME and MATE did not make it this time. They might be back at some point or not. Of course, they are still installable from the repository.</p>

        <p>The released images are a snapshot of Debian unstable, that also goes by the name of Sid, from 2021-02-14. They are enhanced with some useful packages and scripts, an installer based on Calamares and a custom patched version of the Linux kernel 5.10.16, Systemd is at 247.3.</p>
        
        <h3>Plasma at the helm</h3>
        
        <p>Plasma is still our main offering, and it has made amazing progress over the past year. We have it staffed with the latest additions that will hit with Plasma 5.21 in a couple of days, like the new <em>system monitor</em> that will be the successor to <em>ksysguard</em> and the Conference Companion <em>Kongress</em>. Also, years in the making, finally there is <em>kio-fuse</em>. </p>

        <p>The latter allows you to mount remote directories into the root hierarchy of your local file system, thereby exposing KDE's access capabilities like SSH, SAMBA/Windows, FTP, TAR/GZip/BZip2, WebDav and others to POSIX-compliant applications such as Firefox, LibreOffice, GNOME apps, shell utilities and more. Quite the handy tool.</p>
        
        <h3>iNet Wireless Daemon</h3>

        <p>The Xorg and noX flavors come with a new tool to connect your wireless devices. Intels  <em><a href="https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkManager/iwd">iNet wireless daemon</a></em> (<em>iwd</em>) sends WPA-Supplicant into well-earned retirement. Ten times smaller and a lot faster, <em>iwd</em> will be the successor. Further information can be found in the <em><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Iwd">Arch Linux wiki</a></em>.</p>

        <p>If you want to use <em>wpa_supplicant</em> instead of <em>iwd</em> follow the steps below.</p>
        
        <p>First stop and mask iwd.service, stop NetworkManager.service, rename /etc/NetworkManger/conf.d/nm.conf, unmask and start wpa_supplicant.service, start NetworkManager.service again:
        
        <pre>
        sudo systemctl stop iwd.service
        sudo systemctl mask iwd.service
        sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
        sudo mv /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/nm.conf /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/nm.conf~
        sudo systemctl unmask wpa_supplicant.service
        sudo systemctl enable --now wpa_supplicant.service
        sudo systemctl start NetworkManager.service
        </pre>
        </p>
        
        <p>Now you should be able to connect your wireless device with wpa_supplicant.</p>
        
        <h3>Installing iwd</h3>
        
        <p>If you like, you can use <code>iwd</code> in the other flavors too, either on its own or within Network-Manager.</p>        
        
        <p>To easily set iwd up, use these steps:
        <pre>
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install iwd
        sudo systemctl stop wpa_supplicant.service
        sudo systemctl mask wpa_supplicant.service
        sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
        sudo touch /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/nm.conf
        sudo echo -e "[device]\nwifi.backend=iwd" > /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/nm.conf
        sudo touch /etc/iwd/main.conf
        sudo echo -e "[General]\nEnableNetworkConfiguration=true\n\n[Network]\nNameResolvingService=systemd" > /etc/iwd/main.conf
        sudo systemctl enable --now iwd.service
        sudo systemctl start NetworkManager.service
        </pre>
        </p>
        
        <p>Now you should be able to start an interactive shell by running <code>iwctl</code> from a terminal. Entering 'help' in the shell gives you all the options to list, scan and connect to your device or simply use <code>nmtui</code> or <code>nmcli</code> on the command line or the graphical-interface of Network-Manager</p>

        <h3>Why has there been no release since 2018?</h3>

        <p>When the pandemic hit, we were in early preparations for a new release. Changes were mostly worked on for the infrastructure. Shortly thereafter, around April 2020, Alf (agaida), our lead developer vanished from the face of the earth and has not been heard of ever since. We have no idea what happened to him, as all our inquiries into his whereabouts came up empty. So, Alf, if you are reading this, come by and say peep. We miss you.</p>

        <p>That being said, after agaida being in the wind for the better part of a year, we thought it was about time to do a new release without him, but based on his former work before he disappeared. So, we shook off our own corona blues and - tada - here it is, brand new, shiny and still hot off the servers.</p>

        <h3>Official Releases and Isobuilds</h3>

        <p>During our hiatus we built new images ever once in a while to keep the demand for fresh software for new installs covered. These images on <a href="https://isobuilds.siduction.org/">isobuilds</a> are unofficial, were and will continue to be tested by booting and installing them, but that's the extent of testing for that platform. So far, there was no trouble with that scheme. You will still be able to find fresh releases of GNOME and MATE along with the others there about once per month.</p>

        <h3>The following non-free and contrib packages are installed by default:</h3>

        <h3>Non-free</h3>

        <ul><li>amd64-microcode - Processor microcode firmware for AMD CPUs</li><li>firmware-amd-graphics - Binary firmware for AMD/ATI graphics chips</li><li>firmware-atheros - Binary firmware for Atheros wireless cards</li><li>firmware-bnx2 - Binary firmware for Broadcom NetXtremeII</li><li>firmware-bnx2x - Binary firmware for Broadcom NetXtreme II 10Gb</li><li>firmware-brcm80211 - Binary firmware for Broadcom 802.11 wireless card</li><li>firmware-crystalhd - Crystal HD Video Decoder (firmware)</li><li>firmware-intelwimax - Binary firmware for Intel WiMAX Connection</li><li>firmware-iwlwifi - Binary firmware for Intel Wireless cards</li><li>firmware-libertas - Binary firmware for Marvell Libertas 8xxx wireless card</li><li>firmware-linux-nonfree - Binary firmware for various drivers in the Linux kernel</li><li>firmware-misc-nonfree - Binary firmware for various drivers in the Linux kernel</li><li>firmware-myricom - Binary firmware for Myri-10G Ethernet adapters</li><li>firmware-netxen - Binary firmware for QLogic Intelligent Ethernet (3000)</li><li>firmware-qlogic - Binary firmware for QLogic HBAs</li><li>firmware-realtek - Binary firmware for Realtek wired/wifi/BT adapters</li><li>firmware-ti-connectivity - Binary firmware for TI Connectivity wireless network</li><li>firmware-zd1211 - binary firmware for the zd1211rw wireless driver</li><li>intel-microcode - Processor microcode firmware for Intel CPUs</li></ul>

        <h3>Contrib</h3>

        <ul><li>b43-fwcutter - utility for extracting Broadcom 43xx firmware</li><li>firmware-b43-installer - firmware installer for the b43 driver</li><li>firmware-b43legacy-installer - firmware installer for the b43legacy driver</li><li>iucode-tool - Intel processor microcode</li></ul>

        <h3>Return to non-free</h3>

        <p>Right now the installer does not offer an opt-out for packages that do not comply with DFSG, the Debian Free Software Guidelines. That means that non-free packages like unfree firmware will be installed by default on the system. The command<code> vrms</code> will list these packages for you. You can remove not wanted packages manually or remove them all by issuing<code> apt purge $(vrms -s)</code> before or after installation. Else our script <code>remove-nonfree</code> can do that for you.</p>
        
       
        <h3>Installation hints and known issues</h3>

        <ul><li>If you want to reuse your existing home (or any other data) partition, it would be wise to do so after installation and not in the Calamares Installer.</li>

        <li>Encryption setups like LUKS and others are not yet supported by the Installer Framework, you should prepare your partition setup beforehand and might better use the <code>cli-installer</code> in a terminal.</li>
        
        <li>With some Intel GPUs on some devices, you might encounter a frozen system on Live shortly after boot. To fix this you need to set the kernel parameter <code>intel_iommu=igfx_off</code> before booting again.</li></ul>-->

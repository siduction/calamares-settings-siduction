    <h3>Release Notes for siduction 2018.1.0</h3>

    <p>Today we are proud to release siduction 2018.1.0 with the flavours KDE,
    LXQt, GNOME, Cinnamon, MATE, XFCE, LXDE, Xorg and noX. The released images
    are a snapshot of Debian unstable, that also goes by the name of Sid,
    from 2017-28-12. They are enhanced with some useful packages and scripts,
    a brand new installer and a custom patched version of the linux-kernel 4.14,
    accompanied by X-Server 1.19.5-1 and systemd 236-1.</p>

    <p>KDE Plasma stands at version 5.10.5, while GNOME comes in at 3.26 with
    some packages still at 3.24. LXQt ships at 0.12.0 and Xfce at 4.12.4, while
    Cinnamon comes in at 3.4.6 and MATE at 1.18.3. Sadly, right now, GNOME,
    MATE and LXDE are largely unmaintained. If noone steps up to keep them in a
    releaseable state, we might have to drop these flavours with our next release.
    The corresponding packages will stay in the archives.</p>

    <p>This release just comes with a number and no name to it. How we deal with
    this in the future is unclear. The next release, which might be there in March,
    in advance of <a href="https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2018/en/">CLT 2018</a>,
    will ship whatever we come up with. Maybe it'll be just numbersâ€¦ </p>

    <h4>32-bit architecture was retired with last release</h4>
    <p>As already mentioned in the <a href="https://news.siduction.org/2017/02/">news section</a>,
    with the 2017.1.0 release we retired the 32-bit architecture. The work that it took to build
    and maintain that architecture is in our humble opinion better invested in other
    places. Users that still need 32-bit can come talk to us on IRC or send a PM
    and we will try to find a solution for these particular cases.</p>

    <h4>New Installer</h4>
    <p>This is the 2nd release with the new installer built from the
    <a href="https://calamares.io/about/" target="_blank">Calamares Installer Framework</a>
    and we are quite happy with it. It is under steady developement and will in
    the near future improve quite a bit on LVM and LUKS2.</p>

    <p>The partitioning is done by the KDE Partition Manager (KPM). The corresponding
    package is called <code>partitionmanager</code>. Pretty soon, with
    <code>kpmcore 3.3</code> calamares will be able to detect LVM devices better
    and can see pre-existing LVM logical volumes and also perform partitioning
    operations on them. If you install siduction, always make sure to try to update
    the installer in live mode to be able to use the latest features.</p>

    <h4>UEFI installs made easy</h4>
    <p>With Calamares we can proclaim full implementation of UEFI-Installs since 2017.1.0.
    For now we still have encryption with LUKS and LVM turned off, which Calamares offers
    as an option. We want to be on top of that feature before we offer it to you. Offering
    it means we need to be able to support this critical functionality. We do not feel we
    can do this adequatly at the moment, but we will further look into it for our
    next release.</p>

    <h4>Shortcomings</h4>
    <p>There is two things that do not work in Calamares. One is the option to turn
    on SSH before installing the system. Calamares does not offer that and before
    writing a calamares module for this, we decided to just build 2 small packages to
    turn SSH on and off. They are aptly named <em>SSH Activate</em> and
    <em>SSH Deactivate</em> and you can find them in your menu.</p>

    <h4>Recommends enabled</h4>
    <p>Years ago we decided to not install recommends anymore. The handling of
    that feature in Debian was not as we thought it should be. A lot of cruft
    was installed to the system and we wanted to prevent that. Times have changed
    and so has the handling of recommends. So now the recommends that the maintainer
    sets for a package are installed in siduction. If you would like recommends
    not installed, you can override our decision in
    <em>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/80-siduction</em> in the line
    <em>APT::Install-Recommends "1";</em>.</p>

    <h4>Rotation for Journald</h4>
    <p>To prevent the journal from growing too large we have implemented a journal-rotation
    and a maximum size to the journal. You can overrule this setting by editing the
    files in <em>/etc/journal.conf.d/</em>. There will be a blog post on this topic
    within the next days.</p>

    <h4>Non-free software</h4>
    <p>The other option that the installer does not offer anymore is the decision
    to opt-out to allow software to be installed that does not comply with DFSG,
    the Debian Free Software Guidelines. If you did not use the opt-out, non-free
    packages with non-free-firmware enabling your wifi were installed on the system.
    As there is no option to do that in Calamares, for now we have added a script
    called <em>remove-nonfree</em> to siduction-scripts, that will remove any
    non-free packages during installation. A list of the packages involed can be
    seen below. The command <code>apt purge $(vrms -s)</code> will also list these
    packages, should you want to remove them manualy after install. Besides running
    the script, this can be achieved by issuing <code>apt purge $(vrms)</code>.</p>

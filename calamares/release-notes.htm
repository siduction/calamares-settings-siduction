    <h2>Release Notes for siduction 2018.2.0</h2>
    <p>Today we are proud to release siduction 2018.2.0 with the flavours KDE,
    LXQt, GNOME, Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce, Lxde, Xorg and noX. The released images
    are a snapshot of Debian unstable, that also goes by the name of Sid, from
    2018-03-04. They are enhanced with some useful packages and scripts, a
    installer based on Calamares and a custom patched version of the
    linux-kernel 4.15.7, accompanied by X-Server 1.19.5 and systemd 237.4.</p>

    <p>KDE Plasma stands at version 5.12.2, while GNOME comes in at 3.26 with some
    packages still at 3.24. LXQt ships at 0.12.0 and Xfce at 4.12.4, while
    Cinnamon comes in at 3.4.6 and MATE at 1.20.0. Sadly, right now, GNOME,
    MATE and LXDE are largely unmaintained. If noone steps up to keep them in a
    releaseable state, we might have to drop these flavours with our next
    release. The corresponding packages will stay in the archives.</p>

    <p>This release comes with the name "patience 2018.2.0". How we deal with this
    in the future is unclear. The next release will ship whatever we come up
    with. Maybe it'll be just numbersâ€¦</p>

    <h2>Release Highlights</h2>
    <h3>Meltdown &amp; Spectre</h3>
    <p>Shortly after our last release 2018.1.0 the world made acquaintance with two
    vulnerabilities that will stay with us for a long time. In mitigating
    Meltdown &amp; Spectre, siduction was as close to the kernel as possible to
    be able to get fixes in as soon as they roll out. Kernel 4.15.7 has most of
    the bases covered, even though there will be more coming with 4.16 expected
    in April.</p>

    <p>For users to be able to easily check the status of your system regarding
    Meltdown &amp; Spectre, we added the package <em>spectre-meltdown-checker</em>
    to the image. Just call it as root and you will see at a glance where we are
    in that regard.</p>

    <h3>Plasma 5.12, KF 5.42</h3>
    <p>We are happy to say, KDE moved up a notch in Debian and Plasma 5.12 entered
    Sid, accompanied by KDE Frameworks 5.42. Plasma 5.12 is a LTS release and
    has some nice improvements. The dash now has an extra tab which integrates
    plasmoids in the menu. Plasma 5.12 feels more snappy, needs less CPU and
    memory resources. Flatpak is fully integrated in Discover.</p>

    <h3>Ceni removed</h3>
    <p>We have removed Ceni (for setting up <code>/etc/network/interfaces/</code>)
    from all flavours but noX and Xorg. It interfers with Network-Manager and
    speaks only IPv4. Besides that it is easy enough to get a dhcp lease with
    <code>dhclient</code>, if you have a network cable at hand. You can still
    find Ceni in the archive, should you want to install it.</p>

    <h2>Features of siduction 2018.2.0</h2>
    <h3>Recommends enabled</h3>
    <p>Years ago we decided to not install recommends anymore for our releases or
    when the user installs a package. The handling of that feature in Debian was
    not as we thought it should be. A lot of cruft was installed to the system
    and we wanted to prevent that. Times have changed and so has the handling of
    recommends. So now the recommends that the maintainer sets for a package are
    installed in siduction. If you would like recommends not installed, you can
    override our decision in <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/80-siduction</code> in
    the line <code>APT::Install-Recommends "1";</code>.</p>

    <h3>Rotation for Journald</h3>
    <p>To prevent the journal from growing too large we have implemented a
    journal-rotation and a maximum size to the journal. You can overrule this
    setting by editing the files in <code>/etc/journal.conf.d/</code>. There
    will be a blog post on  this topic within the next days.</p>

    <h3>SSH Handling</h3>
    <p>We built two small scripts to turn SSH on and off in the live and in the
    installed system. They are aptly named SSH Activate and SSH Deactivate and
    you can find them in your menu.</p>

    <h3>Calamares - our new installer</h3>
    <p>This is the 3rd release with the new installer built from the Calamares
    Installer Framework and we are quite happy with it. It is under steady
    developement and will in the near future improve quite a bit on LVM and
    LUKS2.</p>

    <p>The partitioning is done by the brand new kpmcore 3.3.1 (git), which is also
    at the heart of the KDE Partition Manager (KPM). The corresponding package
    for that is called partitionmanager.</p>

    <h4>UEFI installs made easy</h4>
    <p>With Calamares we can proclaim full implementation of UEFI-Installs since
    2017.1.0. For now we still have encryption with LUKS and LVM turned off,
    which Calamares offers as an option. We want to be on top of that feature
    before we offer it to you. Offering it means we need to be able to support
    this critical functionality. We do not feel we can do this adequatly at the
    moment, as it is an ongoing developement, that should be more mature with
    kpmcore 3.4.</p>

    <h4>Non-free software</h4>
    <p>The installer does not offer the option to opt-out software that does not
    comply with DFSG, the Debian Free Software Guidelines. That means that
    non-free packages would be installed by default on the system. The command
    <code>vrms</code> will list these packages. One can remove not wanted
    packages manually or remove them all by issuing <code>apt purge $(vrms -s)</code>
    before or after installation</p>

    <p>The very same topic has ruffled feathers on the debian deverloper mailing
    list last month with two extensive threads and a possible future solution
    layed out by Russ Allbery.</p>

    <li><i>iucode-tool</i> - Intel processor microcode</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>New paste script</h2>
    <p>We have retired the old paste-script, that ran under the name
    <code>siduction-paste</code>. It's place was taken by what is now called
    <code>simple-paste</code>. Simple-paste is a cli swiss army-knife for pasting,
    written in bash, powered by pb. It supports command output, different kinds
    of screenshots, (auto-)deletable pastes and much more.</p>

    <h2>32-bit architecture was retired recently</h2>
    <p>As already mentioned in the news section, with the 2017.1.0 release we retired
    the 32-bit architecture. The work that it took to build and maintain that
    architecture is in our humble opinion better invested in other places. Users
    that still need 32-bit can come talk to us on IRC or send a PM and we will
    try to find a solution for these particular cases.</p>
